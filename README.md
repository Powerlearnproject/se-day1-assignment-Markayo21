#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic design, development, and maintenance of software, ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency in the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1950s-1960s: Birth of Software Engineering
Coined during the 1968 NATO Conference to address the "software crisis" caused by growing complexity.
1970s-1980s: Structured Programming & Waterfall Model
Introduction of structured programming (e.g., Pascal, C) and the Waterfall model for systematic software development.
1990s-Present: Agile, DevOps & AI-Driven Development
Shift from rigid models to Agile, DevOps, and AI-driven automation for faster, more adaptive software engineering. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning-Define project scope, goals, budget, and timeline.
Requirements Analysis -Gather and document what the software should do.
Design -Create system architecture, UI/UX, and database design.
Implementation (Coding) -Developers write the actual code.
Testing -Identify and fix bugs to ensure quality.
Deployment -Release the software for users.
Maintenance -Update, fix issues, and improve software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology follows a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. It is rigid, making changes difficult once development begins. Testing is done after development, and customer involvement is minimal until the final product is delivered.
In contrast, the Agile methodology is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous improvements throughout development. Changes can be made at any stage, and testing happens continuously alongside development. Agile encourages frequent customer feedback, ensuring the final product meets evolving user needs.
The Waterfall model is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, such as developing a banking system, where security and compliance are critical, and changes can be costly.
On the other hand, Agile is best for fast-changing projects like mobile app development, where features evolve based on user feedback and market trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer writes, tests, and maintains code, fixes bugs, and collaborates with teams to build efficient software solutions.
A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer designs and executes tests, identifies bugs, and ensures the software meets performance, security, and usability standards.
A Project Manager (PM) oversees planning, coordinates teams, manages resources, tracks progress, and ensures software projects are delivered on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and auto-completion, improving efficiency. Examples include VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes, enabling collaboration and rollback. Examples include Git, SVN, and Mercurial. Both enhance productivity and software quality.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers face challenges like debugging, which can be managed using automated testing and debugging tools. Tight deadlines require Agile methods and task prioritization. Staying updated with technology demands continuous learning. Collaboration issues can be resolved with version control and clear communication, while security risks require secure coding and regular audits.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing checks individual components of code to ensure they function correctly. Integration testing verifies that different modules work together as expected. System testing evaluates the entire software to ensure it meets requirements. Acceptance testing confirms the software meets user needs before deployment. Each type ensures software reliability and quality.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs to optimize AI model responses. It is crucial for improving accuracy, relevance, and efficiency when interacting with AI, ensuring clearer instructions, better outputs, and more meaningful interactions for various applications like coding, content creation, and problem-solving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt: "Tell me about politics."
An improved prompt: "Explain the political factors driving the Russia-Ukraine war, including historical tensions, global alliances, and economic impacts."

The improved prompt is clearer and more specific, ensuring a focused, insightful response rather than a broad, unfocused answer.
